    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- The purpose of grid search cross-validation (GridSearchCV) in machine learning is to systematically search for the best hyperparameters for a given model. Hyperparameters are external configurations to the model that cannot be learned from the data. Grid search performs an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid, evaluating each combination using cross-validation to find the set of hyperparameters that yields the best model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define a parameter grid:**\n",
    "- Specify the hyperparameters and their possible values that you want to search over.\n",
    "**Cross-validation:**\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training and validation sets, then train the model on different hyperparameter combinations using the training set and evaluate each combination on the validation set.\n",
    "**Select the best hyperparameters:**\n",
    "- Choose the combination of hyperparameters that gives the best performance on the validation set.\n",

    "#### Grid Search CV vs. Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grid Search CV:**\n",
    "- It performs an exhaustive search over a predefined set of hyperparameter values. It tries all possible combinations, which can be computationally expensive but ensures thorough exploration of the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomized Search CV:**\n",
    "- It randomly samples a specified number of hyperparameter combinations from the parameter space. This is more computationally efficient than grid search, but it may not explore all combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing between them:**\n",
    "- Use Grid Search CV when you have a relatively small hyperparameter space and computational resources are not a limiting factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Use Randomized Search CV when the hyperparameter space is large, and you want to explore a diverse set of hyperparameter combinations efficiently.\n"
